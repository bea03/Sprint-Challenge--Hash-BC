# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

* Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
        ## An array size is specified when created where as a dynamic array is mutable and can be changed if more space is needed during runtime by copying itself to a larger chunk of memory. 
* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
        ## Usually adding to end takes 0(1) time but if you have to extend the size it takes O(n) time. Inserting at the start usually takes O(n). To access an array it is 0(1)
* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
        ## The arrary is already full and instead of taking 0(1) to add to the array, it will take 0(n) to add to it.

* Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
        ## blockchains are linked by hashed values so you can determine if the record is false or lacks integrity. It contains a ledger of transactions organized:

	•	Index - the number of the block in the chain, starting at 0 or 1, depending on the chain.
	•	Timestamp - the time at which the block was created. This is not required, but is often useful.
	•	Transactions - the monetary transactions, or any type of data, that is proofed by the block.
	•	Proof - the proof for this block. We’ll get into this later.
	•	Previous Hash - the hash of the previous block.

* Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?
        ## It protects against denial-of-service attacks and spam because the work needed out weighs what is gained. When a block is discovered it is added to the chain and the previous value is hashed. If you try to alter the block, you would have to alter previous hashes or the hash will be rejeceted as not valid. The resources to attack or alter a chain would exceed the benefit.
## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least 16 coins.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least 20 times in an hour or two of mining.
